# Simple Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1.  **Open `index.html` in a web browser.**
2.  Move your mouse up and down to control the left paddle.
3.  The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and score points against the AI opponent.
4.  The first to score points wins! (This is a simplification, the game currently does not have a winning condition and can be played indefinitely).
